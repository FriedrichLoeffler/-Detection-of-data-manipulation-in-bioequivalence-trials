# Detection of data manipulation in bioequivalence trials (SaToWIB*)
Here you can find the code for the "SaToWIB routine", based on the idea presented in Anders Fuglsang's publication "Detection of data manipulation in bioequivalence trials".
The code is written in R.

### How to proceed
1. Read *Instructions and explanations.pdf*
2. Download or copy *SaToWIB.R* in your R terminal (maybe you first need to install R and Rstudio)
3. Create a new folder on your device and download *formatted PK data*, which is an example of study data and will be used by the program.
4. Copy the path of the new folder (which contains the *formatted PK data*) and enter the path three times in the *SaToWIB* code as described in chapter 1 of the code.
5. Run the code
6. You might need to run chapter 7 "EXPORT PLOTS TO pdf" of the code step by step (Ctrl+Enter) if you cannot open the *Similarity plasma sample plots.pdf* in your new folder.
7. The results *Similarity plasma sample results.csv* and *Similarity plasma sample plots.pdf* are created in the new folder. As an example of the results please find both files here as well.
8. Please do not hesitate to comment or create issues to improve and expand this article on safe medicines!
